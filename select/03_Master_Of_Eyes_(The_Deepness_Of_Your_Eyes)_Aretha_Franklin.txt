One look in your eyes
Baby, just turns me on
So inviting to me
You know I feel that
They're my home

(Darling, reach out just for me)
And darling, I had to surender with no sense of pride
Your touch from behind on the shoulder's so tender
The deepness of your eyes

I can't stop loving you, baby (the deepness of your eyes)
I feel the loving all the time (the deepness of your eyes)

The wheel of fate and fortune's standing
For a long, long, long day, yeah, yeah, yeah, hoo-aah

People say that the eyes
Tell stories and they mirror the soul
Tell me, do we reflect the sameness of one
The unity to have and to hold?

(Darling, reach out just for me)
I tend our love in quiet seclusion, only you can say
If this is love or just an illusion
The deepness of your eyes

I can't stop loving you, baby (the deepness of your eyes)
I feel the loving all the time (the deepness of your eyes)

The wheel of fate and fortune's standing
For a long, long, long day, yeah

I can't stop loving you, baby (the deepness of your eyes)
I feel the loving all the time (the deepness of your eyes)

I can't stop loving you, baby (the deepness of your eyes), oh, baby
I feel your loving all the time (the deepness of your eyes), na-na-na

I can't stop loving you, baby (the deepness of your eyes)
I feel the loving all the time, (the deepness of your eyes) yes I do

I can't stop loving you, baby (the deepness of your eyes)
I feel the loving all the time (the deepness of your eyes)

I can't stop loving you, baby (the deepness of your eyes), woo, baby
I feel, I feel, I feel the loving all the time (the deepness of your eyes)

I can't stop loving you, baby (the deepness of your eyes)
Loving you baby (the deepness of your eyes), loving you baby, loving you baby
